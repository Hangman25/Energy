### Detailed Breakdown

- **data/**:  
  Contains the raw, processed, and external datasets. Data preprocessing scripts utilize these datasets to prepare training data for the model.
  
- **src/**:  
  - `data_preprocessing.py` is responsible for cleaning the dataset and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis.  
  - `model.py` includes code for training the machine learning model and running predictions. The model is designed to be robust and efficient for real-time forecasting.  
  - `utils.py` holds various helper functions, including data validation, visualization setups, and performance metrics.
  
- **pages/**:  
  The app is structured in a multi-page format to separate concerns and enhance usability. Each page focuses on a particular aspect of the application, making the user experience both organized and interactive.
  
- **app.py**:  
  This is the entry point of the Streamlit application. It initializes the dashboard, manages page navigation, and integrates the different modules.

## Data and Model

### Data

The data used in this project comes from reliable sources and is meticulously preprocessed to ensure high-quality inputs for the model. The datasets include:

- Historical energy consumption records.
- Supplementary data such as weather information, time of day, and other relevant variables that influence energy usage.

### Model

The prediction model is built using popular machine learning libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, XGBoost) and is trained on historical data. It is optimized for:

- **Accuracy:** Employing cross-validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well.
- **Speed:** Designed for real-time prediction, making it suitable for interactive web applications.
- **Scalability:** Easily upgradable as more data becomes available or as the model is further refined.

  The About page provides background information on the project, its development process, and future directions.

## Deployment

This project is built for ease of deployment. The live version is hosted on Streamlit Sharing, but you can also deploy it on other platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or GCP. Ensure your deployment environment satisfies the following:

- Proper configuration of environment variables (if any).
- Adequate resources to run Python and Streamlit applications.
- Setup of web server configurations to handle user traffic efficiently.

For deploying on Streamlit Sharing, simply connect your GitHub repository, and Streamlit will automatically build and serve your app.
