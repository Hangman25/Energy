Detailed Breakdown
data/:
This directory contains the raw, processed, and external datasets. Data preprocessing scripts utilize these datasets to prepare training data for the model.
src/:
data_preprocessing.py is responsible for cleaning the dataset and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis.
model.py includes code for training the machine learning model and running predictions. The model is designed to be robust and efficient for real-time forecasting.
utils.py holds various helper functions, including data validation, visualization setups, and performance metrics.
pages/:
The app is structured in a multi-page format to separate concerns and enhance usability. Each page focuses on a particular aspect of the application, making the user experience both organized and interactive.
app.py:
This is the entry point of the Streamlit application. It initializes the dashboard, manages page navigation, and integrates the different modules.
Data and Model

Data
The data used in this project comes from reliable sources and is meticulously preprocessed to ensure high-quality inputs for the model. The datasets include:

Historical energy consumption records.
Supplementary data such as weather information, time of day, and other relevant variables that influence energy usage.
Model
The prediction model is built using popular machine learning libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, XGBoost) and is trained on historical data. It is optimized for:

Accuracy: Employing cross-validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well.
Speed: Designed for real-time prediction, making it suitable for interactive web applications.
Scalability: Easily upgradable as more data becomes available or as the model is further refined.
Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
